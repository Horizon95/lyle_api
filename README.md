# LylesSutherland PHP API

This is my attempt at the coding assessment. I was not able to fulfil all the requirements exactly due to my inexperience in PHP, so I decided to make a CRUD API for a hypothetical blog. I've made sure to maintain OOP principles. This was a good learning experience for me and I would love to hear feedback on how to make this better or how I should have gone about this. 

## Usage

Download these files locally and then use Postman (https://www.postman.com/) as your HTTP client to make requests, or you can use cURL. Whatever is preferable.
